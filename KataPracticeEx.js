// 3. You're a square!

// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
// And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead,
// you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things!
// If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait!
// That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
// Examples
// isSquare(-1) returns  false
// isSquare(0) returns   true
// isSquare(3) returns   false
// isSquare(4) returns   true
// isSquare(25) returns  true
// isSquare(26) returns  false
